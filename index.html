	<h3>Why am I taking this course?</h3>	
			
		<p>I want to take this class because I want to learn the basic of designing a website without using templates online. Website is a very important form of communication these days so it is one important element of graphic design. Therefore, I think is important for a graphic designer to learn not only the traditional medium of graphic design but also the new platform of this generation. I hope to learn topics related to html, css, and javascript coding. </p>
