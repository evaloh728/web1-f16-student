	<h1>Personal Portfolio Process Page</p>

	<p>Why do I need a Personal Portfolio?</p>

	<p>Do I want to include it as a link on potential job applications?</p>

	<p>Will I show all of your work, or just some?</p>

	<p>What story do I want to tell about myself?</p>

	
	<p> I need a personal porfolio webpage in order to display my design and photography work to potential future employer and client and also my interest and growth as an artist. I would love to include this link on potential job applications in the future. I will be showing the majority of my porfolio work from school, some client work in the past and personal projects as well. I want to show my growth and improvement as a designer and what I am capable of doing in the field of design.</p>
